# A Blog Example Using Next.js, Markdown, and TypeScript

This is a remake of a previous project, now using TypeScript and improved styling.
It demonstrates Next.js's **Static Generation** feature with Markdown files as the data source.

## How It Works

- Blog posts are stored in the `/_posts` directory as Markdown files.
- Adding a new Markdown file will automatically create a new blog post.
- The Markdown content is used to populate props in a page component, resulting in multiple pages with the same layout but different content.
